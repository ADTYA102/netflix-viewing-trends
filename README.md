# Netflix Viewing Trends

This is a data visualization project analyzing various aspects of Netflix's viewing patterns, revenue, and content distribution. The project was built entirely using Jupyter Notebooks in Visual Studio Code, powered by a Python virtual environment (`.venv`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   The notebook `data_cleaning.ipynb` reads the 3 raw datasets from `data/raw/`, performs cleaning (e.g. handling missing values, renaming columns, formatting, etc.), and saves the cleaned versions into `data/processed/`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   The notebook `eda_netflix.ipynb` loads the cleaned datasets and performs:
   - Summary statistics
   - Trend analysis
   - Visualizations (bar plots, line charts, etc.)
   - Identification of key patterns, outliers, and insights

3. **Environment**  
   - All notebooks were developed and run using Visual Studio Code.
   - A Python virtual environment `.venv` is used to manage dependencies.

## üõ† Setup Instructions
‚ö†Ô∏è The .venv folder (Python virtual environment) is not included in this repository, as it's generally not pushed to GitHub for size and portability reasons.

**Step 1: Create a new virtual environment**
python -m venv .venv

**Step 2: Activate the environment**
For Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

**Step 3: Install the required dependencies**
pip install -r requirements.txt

## üìä Datasets Used

All datasets were sourced from Kaggle:
- **MoviesOnStreamingPlatforms_updated.csv**
- **Netflix Revenue updated.csv**
- **TV_Shows.csv**

## üìå Notes

- This project is educational and aimed at showcasing skills in data wrangling, preprocessing, and visualization using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
- The `.venv` folder is not included in GitHub and should be recreated locally via `python -m venv .venv` and installing required libraries via `pip`.
